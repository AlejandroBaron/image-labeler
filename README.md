# image-labeler
Small tool created to ease the labeling process of images for Computer Vision/Object Clasification in Deep Learning



I wanted to make a Neural Network that clasifies animals in mammals,birds,reptiles,amphibians,fish and invertebrates, but first i had to label 5000 pictures I had previously downloaded. 

That's why I made this app, which consists of 2 parts


-convert_to_jpg: this script converts all pictures under "unlabeled/" into .jpg and stores them under "unlabeled_jpg/"

-labeler.py: displays and labels unlabeled pictures, moving them from "unlabeled_jpg/" to "labeled"


Feel free to download and modify this code, just give me some credit ;)
